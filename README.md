# kube-cluster
Microservices simulating a bakery business -- run on Kubernetes  

Still in the works.  

The goal is to have microservices in different languages that all communicate.  
There will also be some kind of container orchestration to facilitate that happening smoothly.

In the future, this Will be run through minikube (so it can be run locally through K8)
